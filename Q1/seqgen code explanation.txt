There are total 8 threads, indexed 0 to 7

there are 7 services and 1 sequencer which are assigned to threads. 
all threads use semaphores for synchronization

services are assigned to threads with index 1 to 7
sequencer is assigned to thread with index 0

gettimeofday() returns time in seconds and microseconds since the epoch. The time is returned in timeval struct, use of timezone struct is obsolete and it should ideally be set to NULL. 

service 1 executes for 90 times! = 3 Hz = each second it executes thrice
service 2 executes for 30 times! = 1 Hz = each second it executes once
service 3 executes for 15 times! = 0.5 Hz executes once every two seconds
service 4 executes for 30 times! = 1 Hz = executes once every second
service 5 executes for 15 times! = 0.5 Hz executes once every two seconds
service 6 executes for 30 times! = 1 Hz executes once every second
service 7 executes for 3 times!  = 0.1 Hz once every 10 sec
